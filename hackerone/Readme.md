# HackerOne UI Issue â€“ Weakness Dropdown Extends Beyond View

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This repository documents a **UI usability issue** found on the [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com) platform. While submitting a vulnerability report, users encounter a problem with the **Weakness Type** dropdown. The list of options extends beyond the visible screen area, making it difficult or impossible to select certain options without scrolling the entire page.
