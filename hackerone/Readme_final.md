# HackerOne UI Issue â€“ Weakness Dropdown Extends Beyond Viewport

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This repository documents a **UI usability issue** found on the [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com) platform. While submitting a vulnerability report, users encounter a problem with the **Weakness Type** dropdown. The list of options extends beyond the visible screen area, making it difficult or impossible to select certain options without scrolling the entire page.

## âœ… Issue Details

- **Affected Page:** `https://hackerone.com/<program>/reports/new?type=team&report_type=vulnerability`  
- **Domain:** `hackerone.com`  
- **Impact:** Users cannot easily select the correct weakness, leading to incomplete or inaccurate reports, which can affect data integrity and user privacy.  
- **Severity (initial triage):** Medium  
- **Final Severity (HackerOne decision):** None (Not Applicable)  
- **Status:** Closed

## ðŸ“‚ Steps to Reproduce

1. Visit the report submission page on HackerOne for any program (e.g., Snapchat).  
2. Scroll to the **Weakness** section.  
3. Click the **Select Weakness Type** dropdown.  
4. Observe that the dropdown extends beyond the viewport and cannot be fully accessed without scrolling the entire page.

## ðŸ›  Expected Behavior

The dropdown should:  
- Stay within the visible viewport, or  
- Allow internal scrolling so all options remain accessible without affecting the page layout.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots

Screenshots are included in this repository to demonstrate how the dropdown is cut off and unusable.
