# Uizard UI Feedback – Export Progress Spacing Issue

**Reported by:** Roshan Kumar Ram  
**Date:** May 30, 2025  
**Platform:** [Uizard.io](https://uizard.io)  
**Type:** Visual UI Design Enhancement


## Description


While exporting a design on Uizard, I noticed that when the progress bar reaches `100%`, the spacing between the `0` and the `%` becomes visually tight or slightly overlapping.

This creates a minor inconsistency in an otherwise polished interface.


## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

1. Create any design in Uizard.
2. Click on **Export**.
3. Observe the export progress bar as it reaches `100%`.

## 💬 My suggestion

Apply minor spacing (margin or letter-spacing) to the `%` symbol or use a different layout/font rule once the progress hits three digits.
