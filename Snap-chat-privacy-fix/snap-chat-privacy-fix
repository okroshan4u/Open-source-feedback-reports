# Snapchat Screenshot Detection Bypass

## 📋 Summary
This research focuses on a privacy-related issue in the Snapchat Android app. Normally, when a user takes a screenshot of a snap or chat, the app notifies the other user. However, it was discovered that using **Google Assistant's screenshot functionality** bypasses this detection, allowing screenshots without triggering notifications.

## 🚨 Vulnerability Type
**Improper Authentication / Privacy Violation** – The app fails to account for alternative screenshot methods at the system level.

## 🛠 Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Snapchat on an Android device and view a snap or chat message.
2. Activate Google Assistant by saying “Hey Google, take a screenshot” or using the device’s shortcut.
3. The screenshot is taken and saved.
4. No notification is sent to the other user about the screenshot being captured.

## ✅ Expected Behavior
Snapchat should notify users whenever a screenshot is taken, regardless of the method used.

## ❌ Actual Behavior
Google Assistant’s screenshot feature bypasses Snapchat’s detection mechanism, resulting in screenshots without notifications.
