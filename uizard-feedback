# Uizard UI Feedback – Export Progress Spacing Issue

**Date Reported:** May 30, 2025  
**Status:** Acknowledged by Uizard support team

## 📝 Description

While using Uizard to export a design, I noticed that once the export progress reaches `100%`, the spacing between the `0` and `%` symbol becomes too tight, creating a small but visible UI inconsistency.

This affects visual clarity at the final export step.

Apply minor spacing (margin or letter-spacing) to the `%` symbol or use a different layout/font rule once the progress hits three digits.
