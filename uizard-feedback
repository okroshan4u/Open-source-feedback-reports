# Uizard UI Feedback – Export Progress Spacing Issue

**Date Reported:** May 30, 2025  
**Status:** Acknowledged by Uizard support team

## 📝 Description

While using Uizard to export a design, I noticed that once the export progress reaches `100%`, the spacing between the `0` and `%` symbol becomes too tight, creating a small but visible UI inconsistency.

This affects visual clarity at the final export step.

## ✅ Action Taken

- Reported the issue via Uizard's official contact form.
- Received a response from support (Karl) confirming it has been escalated to the team.

## 💬 My Suggestion

Apply minor spacing (margin or letter-spacing) to the `%` symbol or use a different layout/font rule once the progress hits three digits.

## 🤝 Takeaway

Even small UI issues matter. I aim to continue contributing visual feedback like this to help improve user experience on tools I use.
